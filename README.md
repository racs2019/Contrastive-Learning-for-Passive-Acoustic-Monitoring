> **A scalable, unsupervised framework for sound source discovery and cross-site comparison in marine soundscapes**

This repository implements the framework introduced in  
**“Contrastive Learning for Passive Acoustic Monitoring: A Framework for Sound Sources Discovery and Cross-Site Comparison in Marine Soundscapes”**  
by *Richard Acs, Ali Ibrahim, Hanqi Zhuang, and Laurent M. Chérubin.*

## Overview

Marine Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) enables long-term, non-invasive biodiversity observation but faces key challenges, including overlapping sources, high noise, and limited labeled data.  
This framework introduces a **domain-adapted contrastive learning pipeline** tailored for noisy marine environments, enabling **unsupervised organization of acoustic recordings**, discovery of recurring acoustic patterns, and comparison across sites and years.

The approach produces embeddings with **strong intrinsic cluster structure** and supports exploratory analysis of biological and anthropogenic sound sources, while requiring **no manual annotations**.

---

## Key Features

- **Unsupervised discovery** of recurring biological and anthropogenic acoustic patterns in reef soundscapes  
- **Teacher-guided multi-positive SimCLR** with local–global invariance and VICReg regularization  
- **Optimized augmentations** for underwater acoustics (spectral notch, frequency masking, noise, shifts)  
- **Cross-site comparison** across Caribbean reef monitoring sites and years (7 core sites; additional sites included in downstream analysis)  
- **Contrastive embeddings** that support downstream clustering, acoustic signature discovery, and exploratory ecological interpretation  

---

## Framework Overview

### Architecture
- **Encoder:** ResNet-18 (1-channel log-Mel spectrogram input)  
- **Projection Head:** 512 → 256 → 128 (BN–ReLU–ℓ2)  
- **Predictor (SimSiam-style):** 128 → 256 → 128 (used for auxiliary local–global invariance)  
- **Teacher Model:** EMA (momentum 0.99 → 0.9995)  
- **Feature Bank:** FIFO queue (size 8,192)

### Objective
The total loss combines contrastive alignment, local–global invariance, and variance regularization:

$$
L_{\text{total}} = \alpha L_{\text{ctr}} + \beta L_{\text{siam}} + \gamma L_{\text{vic}}
$$

with weights: **α = 1.0, β = 0.1, γ = 0.1**

## Dataset

Recordings were collected from **seven core Caribbean spawning aggregation sites (2017–2024)**, with additional sites included during downstream clustering analysis, including:

| Location | Dominant Species | # of Recordings |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Puerto Rico (ALS, ALS Deep, BDS, Mona Elbow) | Red Hind, Nassau Grouper | 260k+ |
| St. Thomas (RHB, GB) | Red Hind, Yellowfin Grouper | 140k+ |
| Mexico (Xcalak, Punta Allen, San Juan) | Nassau Grouper, Toadfish | 100k+ |

Each 20 s clip is segmented into 2 s windows, downsampled to **10 kHz**, and converted into **log-Mel spectrograms** (typically **128 Mel bands**, 0–5 kHz).

---

## Preprocessing & Augmentations

- **Mono conversion & amplitude normalization** to [−1, 1]  
- **Event-centric cropping:** 2 global (256 frames) + 2 local (96 frames) crops  
- **Augmentations:**  
  - Time/frequency masking (SpecAugment)  
  - Spectral notch dropout  
  - Temporal shift/truncation (≤ 12%)  
  - Gaussian noise (σ = 0.01)

## Clustering & Evaluation

| Algorithm | Parameters | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| **K-Means** | k = 6 (label agreement) or k = 60 (intrinsic structure) | Fast, interpretable |
| **GMM** | full covariance | Comparable to K-Means; used for acoustic signature discovery |
| **DBSCAN/HDBSCAN** | adaptive | Often returns few clusters in continuous manifolds |
| **Spectral Clustering** | 10-NN graph | Moderate performance |

### Evaluation Metrics
- **External:** Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI), Hungarian Accuracy  
- **Internal:** Silhouette, Davies–Bouldin Index (DBI), Calinski–Harabasz (CH)

## Results Summary

| Method | ARI | AMI | Hungarian | Silhouette | DBI | CH |
|--------|------|------|------------|-------------|------|------|
| GTCC + MFCC | 0.089 | 0.140 | 0.333 | 0.114 | 2.02 | 422 |
| CNN SupCon | **0.372** | **0.396** | **0.646** | 0.302 | 1.18 | 29,187 |
| **PAM-SimCLR (Ours)** | 0.070 | 0.121 | 0.317 | **0.220** | **1.28** | **16,200** |

> PAM-SimCLR achieves the best **intrinsic cluster structure** among unsupervised methods, while CNN-SupCon maximizes agreement with coarse labels.

## Acoustic Signature Discovery

Across Caribbean reef sites, the framework identified **recurring acoustic patterns**, e.g.:

| Cluster ID | Sites | Frequency (Hz) | Notes |
|-------------|-------|----------------|-------|
| 6 | RHB | 200–800 | Red hind pulse trains |
| 14 | BDS | 200–600 | Marine mammal calls |
| 16 | Xcalak, Punta Allen | 0–600 | Toadfish harmonic calls |
| 19 | Multi-site | 0–100 | Vessel noise |
| 33 | Multi-site | Full (0–800) | Narrowband biotic pulses |

See **Appendix A** for the full acoustic pattern dictionary.
